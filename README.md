# Hotel-Reservation
Repo to learn REST apis using electron framework. 

Will be addressing HLD for classic hotel reservation problem and implementing code off of that.

API designing will be the first here
- Read API(s)
  - get hotels
  - get reservations

- Write API(s)
  - add hotel (admin centric)
  - add room (admin centric)
  - make reservation
